# Beginner-Projects

Basically, I'm new to coding and wanted to find something to learn from. I ended up finding this website/blog that had project ideas. From there I just started making them one by one to gain experience and knowledge. If there is any chance anybody sees this who is a coder, please do send me small projects that would be good to get me further into coding. Thank you!
